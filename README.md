## Development

This extension consists of two main components:

1. The VSCode extension (TypeScript)
2. The Language Server (Rust)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or later)
- Rust and Cargo (latest stable)
- VSCode

### Project Structure

```
solana-vscode/
â”œâ”€â”€ extension/          # TypeScript extension code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/           # Source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bin/           # Language server binary
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json   # Extension manifest
â””â”€â”€ language-server/   # Rust language server code
    â””â”€â”€ src/          # Server source code
```

### Development Workflow

The extension supports several development workflows:

1. **Standard Development**:

   ```bash
   # One-time build
   F5 or "Run Extension" configuration
   ```

2. **Watch Mode**:

   ```bash
   # Command Palette > Tasks: Run Task > Watch Extension and Build Language Server
   # or
   cd extension && npm run watch
   ```

3. **Language Server Development**:
   ```bash
   # Build language server only
   cd extension && ./build-language-server.sh
   ```

### Available Tasks

- `Build Extension and Language Server`: One-time build
- `Watch Extension and Build Language Server`: Build server once and watch extension
- `Build Extension and Language Server (Debug)`: Debug builds

### Testing

```bash
# Extension tests
cd extension && npm test

# Language server tests
cd language-server && cargo test
```

### Packaging

The extension is packaged per platform with its corresponding language server binary. GitHub Actions workflow handles this automatically for releases.

Local packaging:

```bash
cd extension
./build-language-server.sh
npm run build
vsce package
```
